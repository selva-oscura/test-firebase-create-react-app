# test-firebase-create-react-app

Just a quick walk-through / test-its-working on how to connect firebase and create-react-app, write data to firebase, display it in a react app (pathetically minimalistic as this one is), update, and delete data.

Referred to Velocity360's 2016 live demo of building a simple [Chat application using React and Firebase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or3Gp29o6fE) for connecting Firebase data to a React app and [Firebase's own documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/read-and-write).
